/**
 * The tree of countries, states and cities the caller has media in.
 *
 * The API scopes every listing to what the caller can already see, so a place holding nothing
 * visible to them simply does not arrive - there is no permission to check on this side, and an
 * empty listing is a real answer rather than a refusal.
 *
 * Reads are unpaged: each one is scoped to a single parent, so the largest answer is one country's
 * states or one state's cities, and the whole tree is a few hundred nodes.
 *
 * The API also takes a name search across the whole tree and a filter by kind. Neither is used
 * here: on a phone the tree is walked rather than queried, and the drill-down is short enough -
 * three levels - that a search box would be a second way to do what tapping already does.
